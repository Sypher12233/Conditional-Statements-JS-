//We can say that 'switch' statements are the ternary operators of 'else if' statements. If you don't know what a ternary operator is check the other repositories.
//Else if statements are fine if we had a couple of conditions but, what if we had 100s of conditions! Definitely writing that many 'else if' statements would sound like a pain.
//The solution is 'switch statements'. As it provides a syntax that is easier to read and write. 
//A 'switch' statement looks like this;

let groceryItem = 'papaya';
 
switch (groceryItem) {
  case 'tomato':
    console.log('Tomatoes are $0.49');
    break;
  case 'lime':
    console.log('Limes are $1.49');
    break;
  case 'papaya':
    console.log('Papayas are $1.29');
    break;
  default:
    console.log('Invalid item');
    break;
}
 
//The console will print 'Papayas are $1.29'

//Writing the same in 'else if' statement, it would look this;
let groceryItem = 'papaya';
 
if (groceryItem === 'tomato') {
  console.log('Tomatoes are $0.49');
} else if (groceryItem === 'papaya'){
  console.log('Papayas are $1.29');
} else if (groceryItem === 'lime'){
  console.log('Limes are $1.49')
}else {
  console.log('Invalid item');
}
