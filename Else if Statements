//The difference between using 'if...else' and 'else if' is that in 'else if' statements we can get a possible outcome of more than two rather than only two by using the 'if...else' statement.

//Usage of else if: It is used between the 'if' and 'else' operators(after the if and before the else). And 'else if' alse gets a condition. 
//For example;

let stopLight = 'yellow';
 
if (stopLight === 'red') {
  console.log('Stop!');
} else if (stopLight === 'yellow') {
  console.log('Slow down.');
} else if (stopLight === 'green') {
  console.log('Go!');
} else {
  console.log('Caution, unknown!');
}
//As you can see the 'else if' statements allow you to have multiple possible outcomes.
